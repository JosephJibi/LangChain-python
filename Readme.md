### To Run:

1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. source activate: `source ./venv/bin/activate`

### Main package used in this:

`pip install langchain langchain-openai`

### Installation:

1. Make sure venv is installed by running: `sudo apt install python3-venv`
2. To create a new virtual environment in a directory named .venv, run: `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. To activate this virtual environment (which modifies the PATH environment variable), run this: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Now you can install a library like requests in this virtual environment: `pip install requests`
5. After installing your required libraries, you can view all installed libraries by using pip list, or you can generate a text file listing all your project dependencies by running the code: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
6. Instead of having to install each dependency one by one, we can just run the code : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. To deactivate your virtual environment: `deactivate`
